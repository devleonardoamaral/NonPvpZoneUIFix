# How does it work?
This mod fixes the freezing issue when creating larger non-PvP zones by limiting the rendering of off-screen squares (customizable in the UI).

# This mod is incompatible with...
This mod should not present incompatibilities with other mods, however in conjunction with other mods that override the UI of creating non-PvP zones may cause the mod to not work correctly.

# Copyright and attribution
This mod can be added to and extended by anyone in the community, but credit must be given to the original author within the files of the mod - and posted alongside the mod wherever it roams.
